HealConnect is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline-first capabilities. It caches critical data and syncs automatically when connectivity is restored, ensuring rural access remains uninterrupted."    },    {        question: "How do you verify the doctors on the platform?",        answer: "Every doctor undergoes a strict 3-step verification process: License verification with the Medical Council, Identity check (Aadhaar/KYC), and a background credential audit before they can accept consultations."    },    {        question: "Is patient data secure and private?",        answer: "Absolutely. We follow HIPAA & DISHA guidelines. All video calls are end-to-end encrypted via WebRTC, and medical records are stored using AES-256 encryption. Patient consent is mandatory for data sharing."    },    {        question: "Who helps uneducated villagers use the app?",        answer: "Our network of registered ASHA workers and local health facilitators use the 'Health Worker Mode' to register patients, record vitals, and initiate calls on their behalf."    }];const FAQ = () => {    const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(null);    const toggleFAQ = (index) => {        setActiveIndex(activeIndex === index ? null : index);    };    return (        <section className="faq-section">            <div className="container">                <h2 className="section-title">Common Questions</h2>                <div className="faq-list">                    {faqs.map((faq, index) => (                        <div                             key={index}                             className={`faq-item ${activeIndex === index ?
